Regression-based models with Apprentice Chef, Inc. dataset to make revenue prediction.


-Overview-
The executives of Apprentice Chef, Inc. have come to realize that over 90% of revenue comes from customers that have been ordering for 12 months or less, and they want to understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of order by using a regression-based model to predict revenue. 


This is my first individual supervised learning project in the Machine Learning course at Hult International Business School.
